Repository for playing around with an idea for movies and series player website which is running on Django python framework.
Database is POSTGRESQL, but used under Django wrapper.
In database, are stored only entries of movies and episodes, which are collected from hosting server.

Files in the hosting server should be organized under folders with specific naming, which is specified in the parametrisation csv file.
Currently the only API implemented is: api.OpenLoad.co . 

Front end was not build by me, only adapted to be used as Django template.
